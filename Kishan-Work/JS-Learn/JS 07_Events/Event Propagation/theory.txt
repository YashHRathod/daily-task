✅ What is Event Propagation in JavaScript?

When you click on an element, the event does not only happen on that element.
It travels through the DOM tree in a specific order.
This traveling of event is called event propagation.

Example DOM:
<div id="parent">
 <button id="child">Click</button>
</div>
If you click the button, the event involves:

button

then div

then body

then html

then document

But in which order?
That’s where phases come in.

🔁 Three Phases of Event Propagation
1️⃣ Capturing Phase (top → down)

Event goes from:

document → html → body → div → button

Rarely used, but exists.

2️⃣ Target Phase

Event reaches the actual clicked element.

👉 button

3️⃣ Bubbling Phase (bottom → up) ✅ MOST IMPORTANT

Event goes back up:

button → div → body → html → document

👉 By default, JavaScript uses bubbling.

✅ Example: Bubbling in Action
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent clicked");
});

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
});

👉 When you click the button:

Output:

Child clicked
Parent clicked


Why?

Because:

Event hits child

Then bubbles up to parent

✅ Capturing Phase Example
parent.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent");
}, true); // capture = true

child.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child");
}, true);


Now order will be:

Parent
Child


Because event is captured from top to down.

⚠️ But in real projects, 99% you use bubbling, not capturing.

🛑 Stop Event Propagation

Sometimes you DON’T want parent to run.

child.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  console.log("Only child");
});


Now parent will NOT fire.
